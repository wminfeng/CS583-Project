Goal:
This project's goal is to create a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for a robot.
More specifically, the robot in question is similar to the Mars Rover. It moves,
collects soil, temperature, pressure, etc and sends data back to its operators.

Building:
Building this project is very easy, at the moment. Simply start up GHCI and load
the file.
